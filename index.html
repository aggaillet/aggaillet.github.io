                    <p>Development of a Proof of Concept for the remote piloting of freight aircraft.</p>
                    <p>A Graphical User Interface was developed using Java and following participatory prototyping processes.</p> 
                    <p>Communication protocols based on CPDLC and ADS-C were also defined and a feasibility study including an information security assessment was performed. The system also supports audio feedback based on voice synthesis.</p>

                    <p>The Navigation and Attitude System of the <a href="https://skywarder.eu/blog/pyxis-en/">Pyxis rocket</a> is responsible for real-time calculation of the rocket's attitude using data from the on-board sensors.</p>
                    <p>This data is then used to perform altitude control and is trasmitted to the ground station via an array of antennas to allow for flight monitoring.</p>
                    <p>The estimation is done using a Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter containing a lightweight rocket model.</p>
                    <p>The same system is algorithm is used on the guided payload to feed information to the autonomous guidance system.</p>
                    <p>You can see a (now old-ish) version of the system in action <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15U2QjJIRWA&ab_channel=SkywardExperimentalRocketry">here</a>, and a full flight with the resulting telemetry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5FCOSZ5WkA&ab_channel=SkywardExperimentalRocketry">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>The game can be self-hosted and played by up to 3 people over an internet or LAN connection by means of a graphical interface or via command line.</p>

                    <p>The avionics of the Pulsar rocket, the first experimental rocket of <a href="https://astre-toulouse.com/fr/"> ASTRE</a> (Association Spatiale Toulousaine de Recherche Étudiante) is  composed of two indipendent systems handling telemetry and parachute deployment.</p>
                    <p>My work focused on the development of the on-board software for data capture and transmission of telemetry and on the development of a ground system able to display the data to the engineers on ground.</p>
                    <p>Only basic filtering capabilities were present and developed of the rocket's second version will enhance them.</p>
                    <p>The data received on the ground station allowed us to recover the rocket quickly, with a 10 meter accuracy on the estimated landing location</p>
